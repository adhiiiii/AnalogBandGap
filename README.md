## 1. Introduction

Bandgap Reference(Voltage ref) is one of important building block of any analog IC which provides constant ref volatage, independent of supply voltage and temperature changes, which is expected to change in real world   



### Band Gap Reference Classifications
#### Architecture Based
* Self Biased
* Operational Amplifier

#### Application wise
* Low Volatage
* Low Power
* HIgh PSRR & Low noise
* Curvature Compensated

Typical Integrated Circuit / System on Chip (SoC) - "Vref" point of view :

The below diagram shows how "Vef" is connected/distributed to various blocks (ADC,DAC, Digital System..etc)
