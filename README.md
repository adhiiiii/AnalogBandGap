## 1. Introduction

Bandgap Reference(Voltage ref) is one of important building block of any analog IC which provides constant ref volatage, independent of supply voltage and temperature changes, which is expected to change in real world   

Typical Integrated Circuit / System on Chip (SoC) :

### Band Gap Reference Classifications
#### Architecture Based
* Self Biased
* Operational Amplifier

#### Application wise
* Low Volatage
* Low Power
* HIgh PSRR & Low noise
* Curvature Compensated
